BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

definitely not using magic numbers, all the configuration fields are used in the code and are easily changeable in the config file.

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

we did it, we used an array that stores all the PlayerThreads. when the game should finish, we terminated them in reverse order.
it was used in the terminate of Class Dealer.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

we implemented it in our code in updateTimerDisplay method in the class Dealer.we checked if the config.turnTimeoutMillis is less than 0, we display nothing. if it is 0, we display a timer since the last action. we tested it by changing the value of config.turnTimeoutMillis in the config file and checking the display.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
